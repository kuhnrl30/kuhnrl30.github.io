### Projects and Competitions  


- **Analysis of Credit Approval Data**  
The goal of this project was to predict whether an applicant was approved for credit application.  This was my final project in the Advanced Topics in Audit Analytics course at Rutgers University. The course was part of the Masters of Accountancy curriculum and included topics ranging from basic descriptive statistics to the apriori algorithm. I used this project as an opportunity to apply association rules and discover interesting relations between variables. I found association rules to be very effective for understanding the data. I documented the analysis in a report which can be accessed <a href="../writeups/creditanalysis.html"> here</a>.

- **Walmart- Sales in Stormy Weather**  
I rapidly developed a model to predict changes in sales due to changes in the weather.  I say rapid because I found out about this Kaggle competition there was only a few hours left before it ended. The model I developed was simple yet quite effective; I finished in the 51st percentile with a single submission.

- **Random Acts of Pizza**  
Reddit had a discussion group where people can ask others to buy them pizza. The goal of this competition is to predict whether a request would be successful and someone would buy the requester pizza. This competition afforded me the opportunity to learn how to work with JSON formatted data and how to use Classification and Regression Trees (CART). I found this new method is incredibly effective for classification problems provided the model is properly tuned. I started documenting my analysis <a href="../writeups/RAOP.html">here</a> but it's still a work in progress. I hope to finish it soon.

- **Predicting Dropouts in MOOC**  
The objective of the KDD Cup 2015 was to predict if a student would drop out from a MOOC in the next 10 days. The dataset included distinct data points on course resources from multiple MOOCs and a log file showing when a student accessed the course resource.  I had never setup parallel processing before so I used this competition to work with the doParrallel package.

- **New York Times**  
The objective of this Kaggle compettion was to predict whether a NY Times blog post would be successful or not. It was the capstone project for the [Analytics Edge](https://www.edx.org/course/analytics-edge-mitx-15-071x-0) course I took through edX. This was my first exposure to text mining using using the term frequency matrix.

- **Africa Soil Property Prediction**  
The objective of this Kaggle was to predict numerical soil properties from spectrometer readings. The dataset had several hundred variables to predict 4 target variables so I used this competition to work with dimension reduction techniques. I was able to implement both Support Vector Machines (SVM) and Principle Component Analysis (PCA) methods in my models. Unfortunately, pure motivation wasn't enough in this challenge; it required domain knowledge to be successful. I still can't understand the soil science behind this competition but it was fun to work with!

- **Titanic: Machine Learning from Disaster**  
This was my first machine learning competition where I cut my teeth with R. The competition was hosted by Kaggle. Kaggle provides tutorials on how to complete this competition with both R and Python. Since it was such a project to learn R, I've decided to return to the tutorials to learn Python.

- **New Jersey State Employee Payroll**   
This project was my first experience in designing a Shiny application and to work with CSS. The project was started to meet the requirements of a course in the Data Science Specialization on Coursera. The application is hosted on Shinyapps.io and can be found <a href="https://kuhnrl30.shinyapps.io/ShinyProject" target="_blank"> here</a>.
