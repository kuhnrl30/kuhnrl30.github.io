### Projects and Competitions  
- **Analysis of Credit Approval Data**  
This project was the final project of the Advanced Topics in Audit Analytics course at Rutgers University. 
The course was part of the Masters of Accountancy curriculum and included topics ranging from basic descriptive statistics to apriori algorithms. 
I used this project as an opportunity to apply association rules using the arule package. 
I found these association rules were effecive in understanding the data but it wschallenging to vectorize them to predict values missing values.
The data was downloaded from the [UCI Machine Learning Repository](http://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets.html?format=&task=&att=&area=bus&numAtt=&numIns=&type=&sort=nameUp&view=table). 
The analysis wass documented in a report format and can be accessed <a href="../writeups/creditanalysis.html"> here</a>.  
  
- **Walmart- Sales in Stormy Weather**  
When I found out about this [Kaggle](http://www.kaggle.com/c/walmart-recruiting-sales-in-stormy-weather/leaderboard) competition, there was only a few days left before it ended. 
Therefore, this was an exercise in rapid development. 
The model I developed was simple yet quite effective; I finished in the 51st percentile  
  
- **Random Acts of Pizza**  
[Kaggle](http://www.kaggle.com/c/random-acts-of-pizza), <a href="../writeups/RAOP.html">Writeup --In progress</a>  
  
- **Predicting dropouts in MOOC**  
The objective of the [KDD Cup 2015](https://kddcup2015.com/submission-rank.html) was to predict if a student would drop out from a MOOC in the next 10 days. 
The dataset included distinct datapoints on course resources from multiple MOOCs and a log file showing when a student accessed the course resource. 
I had never setup parallel processing before so I used this competition to work with the doParrallel package. 

- **Africa Soil Property Prediction**  
This competition was also hosted by [Kaggle](http://www.kaggle.com/c/afsis-soil-properties).  
    
- **Titanic: Machine Learning from Disaster**  
This was my first machine learning competition where I cut my teeth with R. 
The competition was hosted by [Kaggle](http://www.kaggle.com/c/titanic-gettingStarted). 
Kaggle provides tutorials on how to complete this competition with both R and Python. 
Since it was such a project to learn R, I've decided to return to the tutorials to learn Python.  
    
- **New Jersey State Employee Payroll**   
This project is my first experience in designing a Shiny application and to work with CSS. 
The project was started to meet the requirements of a course in the Data Science Specialization on coursera. 
The application is hosted on Shinyapps.io and can be found <a href="https://kuhnrl30.shinyapps.io/ShinyProject" target="_blank"> here</a>.
