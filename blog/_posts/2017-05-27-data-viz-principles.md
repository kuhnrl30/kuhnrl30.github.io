### Why you should know Edward Tufte?
Edward Tufte is a master of data visualization. He's written several books about the subject using examples through history to illustrate what makes for a good visualization. 



### Data Vizualization Principles  
To start off, let's list Tufte's principles. Graphical excellence:  

1. ...is the well-designed presentation of interesting data- a matter of substance, of statistics, and of design.
2. ...consists of complex ideas communicated with clarity, precision, and efficiency.  
3. ...is that which gives the the viewer the greatest number of ideas in the shortest time with the least ink in the smallest space.  
4. ...is nearly always multivariate.  
5. ...requires telling the truth about the data. 

### Why don't we use these in business?  
We use a lot of powerpoint decks in business.  For the sake of discussion, lets assume that slide decks are the best way to convey business information.


#### 1. Graphical excellence is the well-designed presentation of interesting data- a matter of substance, of statistics, and of design.
Making good data visualizations requires skills in multiple disciplies. You'll need to build a strong foundation with reliable and complete data requiring you to perform some level of investigative work to verify you have everything you need and you've adjusted for errors in data measurements.  Next, you'll have to summarize the data using statistics.  Your statistics can be simple averages and ranges or can be as complex as euclidian distances or correlations.  In either case, you'll need to summarize the data so that your audience can understand your message quickly.  Finally, a little bit of artistry to make the chart aesthetically pleasing but of course the artistic flair should not distract from the data and the story you are presenting. 

#### 2. Graphical excellence consists of complex ideas communicated with clarity, precision, and efficiency.

#### 3. Graphical excellene is that which gives the the viewer the greatest number of ideas in the shortest time with the least ink in the smallest space.  
Often in business we don't want to give the viewer a large number of ideas at any single point in time.  We come with a single message per slide and once that is understood, we move to a new slide with a new topic that builds on the first.  This method uses much more ink than would be needed in a single but complex chart. 

#### 4. Graphical excellence is nearly always multivariate.  
#### 5. Graphical excellence requires telling the truth about the data.
