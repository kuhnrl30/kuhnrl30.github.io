### Why you should know Edward Tufte?
Short biography to establish credibility and prominence 



### Data Vizualization Principles  
To start off, let's list Tufte's principles. Graphical excellence:
1. ...is the well-designed presentation of interesting data- a matter of substance, of statistics, and of design.
2. ...consists of complex ideas communicated with clarity, precision, and efficiency.  
3. ...is that which gives the the viewer the greatest number of ideas in the shortest time with the least ink in the smallest space.  
4. ...is nearly always multivariate.  
5. ...requires telling the truth about the data. 

### Why don't we use these in business?  
We use a lot of powerpoint decks in business.  This is an issue in itself but for now, let's just take the assumption that Powerpoint is the right medium for presenting financial results. 


#### 1. Graphical excellence is the well-designed presentation of interesting data- a matter of substance, of statistics, and of design.
Making good data visualizations requires skills in multiple disciplies. You'll need to build a strong foundation with reliable and complete data requiring you to perform some level of investigative work to verify you have everything you need and you've adjusted for all the known errors.  Next, you'll have to summarize the data using statistics.  Your statistics can be simple averages and ranges or can be as complex as euclidian distances or correlations.  In either case, you'll need to summarize the data so that your audience can understand your message quickly.  Finally, a little bit of artistry to make the chart aesthetically pleasing but of course the artistic flair should not distract from the data and the story you are presenting.
