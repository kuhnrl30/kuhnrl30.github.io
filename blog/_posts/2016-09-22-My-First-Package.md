description: "Celebrating a milestone in my R career- submitting a package to CRAN"

#### I'm taking a moment to celebrate this victory: I submitted my first package to CRAN.  

CRAN is the Comprehensive R Archive Network where R packages are available for everyone to download. I've built packages before but was never confident enough to publish them beyond GitHub. Well that changed tonight, and after a few weeks of development and documentation I finally submitted the LendingClub package.  I should hear back in a few days if its accepted.  

You can learn more about the package from my [this post](/blog/introducing-LendingClub-package) or by visiting [GitHub](www.github.com/kuhnrl30/LendingClub).
