## Functions can make it easier to work with complex equations

Excel is a very powerful tool for data analysis with many built in capabilities such as the Analysis Tool-pak.  However, there are times when you want to do something Excal doesn't support or would be very complex to implement.  By using the power of VBA and user-defined functions, you can expand Excel's capabilities  or to remove complexity. The perfect se case is for nested formulas and if you've ever written a nested-if formulat, you know how difficult these can be.  If you are not familiar with the concept of nested formulas, they happen when you put one formula inside of another formula.  Consider an example several if-then formulas.  


```vba
Public Function ChooseIt() as variant



```
