title: Home Depot Search Relevancy
---

<b>Objective: </b>
Consumers use the search feature on Home Depot's website looking for the products they need.  It is in Home Depot's interest to connect them with with that product quickly before they turn to a competitor. To that end, the search results need to be relevent to the query.  In this competition, I was given a search query and built a model scored whether a product is relevant to the inputs. Conceptually, the score would be used to rank the products and determine which would show up in the search results.
