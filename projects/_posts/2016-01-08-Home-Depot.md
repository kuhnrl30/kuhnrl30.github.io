git: https://github.com/kuhnrl30/HomeDepot
objective: Consumers use the search feature on Home Depot's website looking for the products they need.  Home Depot wants to connect them with with that product quickly before they turn to a competitor. To that end, the search results need to be relevent to the query.  In this competition, I was given a search query and built a model which scored whether a product is relevant to the inputs. Conceptually, the score would be used to rank the products and determine which would show up in the search results.
