	<p class="lead">Hi, I'm <span itemprop="name">Ryan Kuhn</span> and I turn data into decisions.</p>
	
	<p>I have 5+ years of experience turning data into insights that drive business decisions. Currently, I work in a sales support role at <a href="http://www.questdiagnostics.com" target="_blank"> Quest Diagnostics</a> where I build strategic profitability models to drive revenue growth.  Previously, I worked in auditing where I used a mixture of data analytics and interviews to reduce exposure to business risks. In my free time, I work to expand my skills in advanced analytics such as machine learning and data visualization.</p>
	
	<p>I'm also available for hire as a <span itemprop="title">freelance data analyst or a financial consultant.</span> <a href="contact">Drop me a line</a> about your project if you're interested in working with me.</p>
