	<p class="lead">Hi, I'm <span itemprop="name">Ryan Kuhn</span> and I turn data into decisions.</p>
	
	<p>I have been turning data into insights that drive business decisions for the past 5 years. I'm currently working in operations finance at <a href="http://www.orthoclinical.com" target="_blank"> Ortho Clinical Diagnostics</a> where I consolidate performance reporting across several plants.  Previously, I used data analytics to increase revenue in a sales finance role and to reduce risks when working in an audit role. In my free time, I work to expand my skills in advanced analytics such as machine learning and data visualization.</p>

	<p>I'm available for hire as a freelance <span itemprop="jobTitle">Data Analyst</span>. <a href="contact">Drop me a line</a> about your project if you're interested in working with me.</p>
