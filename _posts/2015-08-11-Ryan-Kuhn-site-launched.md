Well,  the time had finally come for me to laucnch my own website. I've learned so much on my path through the Open Source Data Science Masters program and I hope to share my thoughts about what I've learned along the way. For starters, I've learned so much about R that I use it regularly in my role at Quest in preparing financial models. It seems like yesterday that I was learning how to load a dataset and now I'm brainstorming topics to build my first package.  

One of my next steps will be to bring the advanced methods I've learned through MOOCs and Kaggle competitions into the workplace. I know there is room for us to grow and I look forward to sharing what I've learned with the team. More to come!
