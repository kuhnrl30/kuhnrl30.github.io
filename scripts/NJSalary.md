description: Code used to build a Shiny app.  The app allows users to compare their salary to that of the New Jersey State Employees

### UI.R
This block of code generates the user interface for the app.  It defines the input boxes, tabbed content, and the descriptive text explaining the source of the data.

  #Application Title
  headerPanel("NJ State Employee Salaries"),
  
  # Sidebar with controls to select which year of data to pull and 
  # to enter the users salary. The helpText function is used to 
  # disclaim the number of datapoints used in the chart and to 
  # imply the methodology. Sepcifically, to call out that only 
  # the first 1,000 data points are used which is not a statistical
  # sample of salaries. The submitButton defers the rendering of output 
  # until the user explicitly clicks the button (rather than doing it 
  # immediately when inputs change). This is useful because the function 
  # submits an API call and then must format the data before it is 
  # presented.
